The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don\\u2019t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students\\u2019 work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people\\u2019s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates\\u2019 difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn\\u2019t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.\",\n          \"While some may argue that the primary purpose of education is to prepare students for the workforce, I strongly disagree with this statement. Education is a multifaceted institution that serves various purposes, and its primary goal should not be limited to workforce preparation.\\n\\nFirstly, education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By exposing students to diverse subjects and ideas, education helps them develop analytical minds, enabling them to navigate complex situations and make informed decisions. These skills are essential not only in the workforce but also in personal and civic life. For instance, a well-educated individual can critically evaluate information, identify biases, and make sound judgments, which are vital for effective participation in democratic processes.\\n\\nSecondly, education fosters personal growth and development, allowing individuals to explore their interests and passions. By providing opportunities for students to engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and creative pursuits, education helps them discover their strengths and weaknesses, build confidence, and develop a sense of purpose. This, in turn, enables them to lead fulfilling lives, regardless of their career choices. For example, a student who excels in music or art may not necessarily pursue a career in these fields but can still benefit from the skills and values they acquired through their education.\\n\\nLastly, education has a profound impact on individuals' social and emotional well-being. By promoting empathy, tolerance, and understanding, education helps students develop positive relationships with others, build strong communities, and contribute to the greater good. This is evident in the many examples of educators and alumni who have made significant contributions to social justice, environmental sustainability, and humanitarian causes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while education can certainly prepare students for the workforce, its primary purpose should be to empower individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to lead fulfilling lives, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world.\",\n          \"I disagree with the statement that the development of artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it will eliminate. While it is true that AI has the potential to automate certain tasks, I believe that its impact on job creation will be limited.\\n\\nFirstly, AI will undoubtedly replace many jobs that are repetitive, routine, and can be easily automated. For instance, self-service kiosks are already replacing cashiers in many retail stores. Similarly, AI-powered chatbots are taking over customer service roles. These jobs will be eliminated, and many workers will struggle to adapt to the changing job market.\\n\\nMoreover, the development of AI will also lead to the creation of new jobs in fields such as AI development, deployment, and maintenance. However, these jobs will require highly specialized skills and education, which not everyone possesses. In addition, the number of new jobs created in these fields will likely be limited compared to the number of jobs eliminated.\\n\\nFurthermore, the benefits of AI, such as increased productivity and efficiency, will likely be concentrated among a small group of companies and individuals, rather than being evenly distributed across the workforce. This could exacerbate income inequality and create new social and economic challenges.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits, I believe that its impact on job creation will be limited. The jobs that are eliminated will likely outweigh the new jobs created, and the benefits of AI will be concentrated among a small group of individuals. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the development of artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it will eliminate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If a person tries new experiences and discovers new things, then he or she has the possibility to learn to do those things very well and to develop them becoming successful in doing those things. As a result this person would be considered a pioneer by other people in the \\\"area\\\" she's working at. For example, to become successful a manager could find out a new way of running his business: for istance he could try to improve the methods of working, to decrease costs or to make people work harder by using promotions. This manager would  be recognized as a successful person because he has discovered a new way of working that allows the factory to save money, time and to do better.\\nMoreover I believe that successful people are used to taking risks more than other people do because of their enthusiasm for new situations and because they have an optimist view of the situation that they have to face with. In fact being an enthusiastic and optimistic person helps to face new situations and helps working out good solutions to problems. For example, if a manager strongly believes in what he is doing, I'm pretty sure that he will achieve his aim; if this manager stongly believes in his decisions, he won't stop working when he will meet difficulties or problems, but he will work harder to find a solution and go on doing what he has planned to do.\\nIn conclusion, I completly agree with the statement above and I think that only successful people could improve and bring new aspects in the world because doing always the same thing, though it is well done, doesn't bring, in a long time, new ideas and consequently improvements at all.\",\n          \"Everyone wants to be successfull. However cooking a pitza is not a success. The question is `which accomplishment is a success?`. An accomplishment is called success when it is something rare. Success comes from trying and working for new, risky and higher level accomplishments. \\nFirst of all, a successfull person can not be the model of an old successfull person. For example an architect builds an extra-ordinary building and create a new approach which is second to none in his area. An other architect reads many articles about the above mentioned approach and builds a new building with the same style, or approach. Which one would you like to call successfull? Of course the first one.\\nSecondly, accomplishing something which is already accomplished by someone else is not success. Take the risk and try something harder! As an example, one racer finishes the race in 5 minutes. If the other one want to be successfull then he should risk his life and drive faster. Moreover, in pc games the player is only successfull when he or she reaches the top score, which means he or she is better than the last player.\\nIn contrast, some lazy people argues that doing the thing they know the best is the success. I call them robots. Do you see any difference? Robots are doing what they can do the best. They are of course successfull in being a robot, however not a successfull human.\\nAll in all, in my opinion there is a big difference between success and accomplishment. Success is the new, risky and top level accomplishment. Only doing what you already know how to do is next to nothing.\",\n          \"I agrre it. I think successful pelple tried new things and taked risks. Try is make a light of future. But some people get damage after tried, but I think all success pople got damage before success.They tried again and again and get success. \\n First of all, if you try to something and try to accomplish, you should get a lot of problem at the middle, but do not quit when you tired. because you have a lot of chances yet. New things did not try to everybody, so if you accomplish it, you could make a big future. \\n Second, look at the around who success people. They do not say get easy about success. They got a lot of wall and became a miserable then they became a rich or famous. \\n Third, new things could makes us huppy. Now, we have a lot of technology. For example, television, call phone, car, and micro chip that makes us better than long years ago. If we do not have them right now, we can not live in this world. In addition, thechnology is developing now too. \\n Im deed, I think we have to agree it, because you living and using in the new technology world, so it means that meny people tried and accomplish something. Why do not dissagree it? If you try to something, we could get a lot of new things than now.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, I believe that both young and old can find profound joy in life, albeit in different ways.\\nYoung people often have the advantage of physical vitality and a sense of limitless possibilities. They are less burdened by responsibilities and can explore new experiences with a sense of adventure. For example, a young person might find immense joy in traveling the world, pursuing a new hobby, or simply spending time with friends. However, this carefree spirit can also be fleeting and may be overshadowed by anxieties about the future, pressure to succeed, and the constant need for validation.\\nOlder people, on the other hand, may have a more nuanced understanding of life's complexities. They have accumulated wisdom through years of experience, learned to appreciate the simple things, and developed deeper relationships. The joy they find may stem from the satisfaction of achieving their goals, witnessing the growth of their families, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their later years. For instance, a retired teacher might find immense joy in mentoring young students or volunteering in their community.\\nUltimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that is influenced by a multitude of factors, including age, personality, and life circumstances. While young people may have a more carefree approach to life, older people can find profound joy in the wisdom and contentment that comes with age. Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness, and it is a mistake to assume that one is inherently more enjoyable than the other.\",\n          \"Certain people believe that young people enjoy life more that older people do. On the other hand some people disagree with the idea of young people enjoying life more than older people do. In my personal opition, I strongly agree with the fact that younger people have relatively more time to enjoy life than old people do for several reasons according to the amount of responsibility, energy and time. \\t\\n\\n\\tOne of the major reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older poeple do is closely related to the amount of responsibilities that older people and younger people have. In my opinion, getting older means receiving more responsibility. Based on my personal experience, as a high school student, I used to play games, meet friends, and did not worry that much on my future. However, as I grow older, I started to feel pressure, get responsibility and worry about my future which I have to prepare from now on. As a result, I strongly agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do.\\n\\n\\tAnother main reason that young people enjoy life more than older people is based on the amount of energy that young people and old people can spend and enjoy. For example, based on my personal experience, I used to eager to travel and visit foreign contries when I was young. However, as a grow older and I receive more responsibility, I started to get lazy about enjoying life. In addition, I put the studying primary than enjoying my life. It is the reason why most parents sacrify their enjoy for their children because they have the responsibility of being parents.\\n\\n\\tLast but not least, another huge reason that young people enjoy life more that older people is closely connected with the amount of time that young people and older people contain. As I stated above, as people grow older, more responsibilities they get. Therefore, older people will have less time to enjoy their leisure time.\\n\\n\\tBased on the amount of responsibility, energy and time, I strongly agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more that older people do. Therefore, I would recommend young people to enjoy their life before they grow older.\",\n          \"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers a profound understanding of a particular field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This broader perspective fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and equips individuals with a more comprehensive understanding of the world.\\nFirstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop a thirst for learning and a desire to explore new ideas. This curiosity fuels their pursuit of knowledge beyond their chosen field, leading to a more holistic understanding of the world. For instance, a student with a broad knowledge of history, literature, and science can connect historical events to scientific advancements and literary interpretations, fostering a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge.\\nFurthermore, a broad education enhances critical thinking skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential in navigating the complexities of modern society, where information is readily available but often unreliable.\\nFinally, a broad knowledge base provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By studying diverse subjects, individuals gain insights into different cultures, societies, and perspectives. This understanding fosters empathy, tolerance, and a greater appreciation for the complexities of human experience. For example, a student with knowledge of economics, sociology, and political science can better understand the factors that contribute to social inequality and develop informed solutions.\\nIn conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and equipped to navigate the challenges of the 21st century.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, I believe that both young and old can find profound joy in life, albeit in different ways.\\nYoung people often have the advantage of physical vitality and a sense of limitless possibilities. They are less burdened by responsibilities and can explore new experiences with a sense of adventure. For example, a young person might find immense joy in traveling the world, pursuing a new hobby, or simply spending time with friends. However, this carefree spirit can also be fleeting and may be overshadowed by anxieties about the future, pressure to succeed, and the constant need for validation.\\nOlder people, on the other hand, may have a more nuanced understanding of life's complexities. They have accumulated wisdom through years of experience, learned to appreciate the simple things, and developed deeper relationships. The joy they find may stem from the satisfaction of achieving their goals, witnessing the growth of their families, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their later years. For instance, a retired teacher might find immense joy in mentoring young students or volunteering in their community.\\nUltimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that is influenced by a multitude of factors, including age, personality, and life circumstances. While young people may have a more carefree approach to life, older people can find profound joy in the wisdom and contentment that comes with age. Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness, and it is a mistake to assume that one is inherently more enjoyable than the other.\",\n          \"Certain people believe that young people enjoy life more that older people do. On the other hand some people disagree with the idea of young people enjoying life more than older people do. In my personal opition, I strongly agree with the fact that younger people have relatively more time to enjoy life than old people do for several reasons according to the amount of responsibility, energy and time. \\t\\n\\n\\tOne of the major reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older poeple do is closely related to the amount of responsibilities that older people and younger people have. In my opinion, getting older means receiving more responsibility. Based on my personal experience, as a high school student, I used to play games, meet friends, and did not worry that much on my future. However, as I grow older, I started to feel pressure, get responsibility and worry about my future which I have to prepare from now on. As a result, I strongly agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do.\\n\\n\\tAnother main reason that young people enjoy life more than older people is based on the amount of energy that young people and old people can spend and enjoy. For example, based on my personal experience, I used to eager to travel and visit foreign contries when I was young. However, as a grow older and I receive more responsibility, I started to get lazy about enjoying life. In addition, I put the studying primary than enjoying my life. It is the reason why most parents sacrify their enjoy for their children because they have the responsibility of being parents.\\n\\n\\tLast but not least, another huge reason that young people enjoy life more that older people is closely connected with the amount of time that young people and older people contain. As I stated above, as people grow older, more responsibilities they get. Therefore, older people will have less time to enjoy their leisure time.\\n\\n\\tBased on the amount of responsibility, energy and time, I strongly agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more that older people do. Therefore, I would recommend young people to enjoy their life before they grow older.\",\n          \"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers a profound understanding of a particular field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This broader perspective fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and equips individuals with a more comprehensive understanding of the world.\\nFirstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop a thirst for learning and a desire to explore new ideas. This curiosity fuels their pursuit of knowledge beyond their chosen field, leading to a more holistic understanding of the world. For instance, a student with a broad knowledge of history, literature, and science can connect historical events to scientific advancements and literary interpretations, fostering a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge.\\nFurthermore, a broad education enhances critical thinking skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential in navigating the complexities of modern society, where information is readily available but often unreliable.\\nFinally, a broad knowledge base provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By studying diverse subjects, individuals gain insights into different cultures, societies, and perspectives. This understanding fosters empathy, tolerance, and a greater appreciation for the complexities of human experience. For example, a student with knowledge of economics, sociology, and political science can better understand the factors that contribute to social inequality and develop informed solutions.\\nIn conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
